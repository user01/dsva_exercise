# Number Task Challenge

Multiple implementations of a simple (and apparently unproven) system on positive integers. The logic is as follows:

    If integer is 1, stop
    If integer is even, divide by 2, repeat
    If integer is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1, repeat

Every language version should exist in the project root as `[language]_version`. Each version should have a README.md for how to run and test the particular values.
